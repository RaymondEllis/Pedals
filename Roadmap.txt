This is more like a to do list. But it works :)

*Work on debuging. Better unhandled error messages.
*Allow you to use MIDI pedals like a joystick

*Fix new UI so it looks better and is easyer to use.
*Remove old code.
*Comment new code.
*Add check to make sure you are not adding a second device.
