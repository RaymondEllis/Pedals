This is more like a to do list. But it works :)

*Work on debuging. Better unhandled error messages.
*Add the ability to add more joysticks to MIDI out
*Allow you to use MIDI pedals like a joystick

*New UI
	Allow user to add(and copy) MIDI input devices to a list.
		Would looke something like this:
		'MIDI Input			MIDI Output	'
		'kX Control			kX Synth	'

		Which would then have the joystick/keyboard/midi Input independently of others.
		Start and stop independently of others.
		Would not allow adding the same MIDI input device and MIDI channel.
		Would be best if the MIDI output device was always runing.


	Add a list for Input. So you can have more then the three pedals.
		Would show up in the list like this:
		'Input								Output				'
		'Joystick	ID:1	Axis:2			MIDI	HoldPedal1	'
		'Keyboard	ID:0	Key:Space		MIDI	NoteC1		'
